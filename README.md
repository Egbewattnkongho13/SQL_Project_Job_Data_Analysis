## Background
The tech industry, particularly the data space, is rapidly evolving with varying compensation packages and skill requirements. Understanding these trends is crucial for:
- Career planning in data engineering
- Identifying valuable skills to acquire
- Understanding market demands
- Making informed career decisions

Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql).  It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data Engineer jobs?
2. what skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data Engineer?
4. which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
6. What Jobs are in my Local area that are available?

## Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data engineer job market, I used the power of several key tools:

- **PostgreSQL:** THe main (Primary database) management system,
ideal for handling the job osting data.
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, permitting me to 
query the database and find critical insights and analysis.
- **Git and Github:** Important version control handler and ensures that my workflow
is in order. Powerful tool for sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring
collaboration and project management.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My main go-to for database management
and executing SQL queries.


## The Analysis
The project focuses on several key areas of the data engineer job market.
Here's how I approached each  question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Engineer Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered
data engineer positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote
jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    (job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere') AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY  salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
WITH top_paying_local_job AS(
SELECT
    DISTINCT job_location,
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    company_id
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE job_location LIKE '%Cameroon'
)
SELECT 
    top_paying_local_job.company_id,
    top_paying_local_job.job_id,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    top_paying_local_job.job_location,
    top_paying_local_job.job_title_short,
    company_dim.link_google AS company_link
FROM company_dim
INNER JOIN top_paying_local_job
ON
    company_dim.company_id = top_paying_local_job.company_id;
```

#### Jobs in My Local Area
